# Route Planning Project

This is the first project for the Udacity C++ Nanodegree.

It mainly covers the fundamentals of C++.

The Route planner essentially takes coordinates on a map for a starting point and an ending point and then uses IO2D map data to chart the shortest route there. To find the shortest route, the A*Search method is used.
